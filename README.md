# FCPS SIS GradeView

An app for FCPS SIS.

## To-Do List:
 - [ ] quarters during grade-fetching is hard-coded to 'third_quarter', fix this to be generic (get first element in dynamic)
 - [ ] noInternet snackbar is being triggered even if login is successful
 - [x] some assignment names are too long for cards in Course view
 - [ ] prevent double-clicking login button
 - [ ] show teacher email next to course id/name, open mail app on click
 - [x] fix padding
